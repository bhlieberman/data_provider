# DataProvider

A series of bad ideas motivated by a desire to relearn Python and write less boilerplate. I have scraped a lot of HTML in my life; I am tired of it. I am taking some inspiration from Clojure here to abstract away the meaty parts of fetching remote resources, and to do so declaratively, but with a Pythonic twist.
